Zephyr 2.0 is finally here!

Note: Zephyr 2.0 requires the new desktop client (available on Steam). Existing desktop clients are not compatible and will not update.

Zephyr has been completely rewritten and includes some awesome new features, including:

- A brand new design
- Seamlessly pair with the desktop client using local network discovery, a QR code, or a short join code
- View notification history on desktop and within VR

Thanks to all beta testers who made this release a reality!
